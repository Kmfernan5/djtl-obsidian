Rewrite for clarity.  Samsung Galaxy Tab S7/S7+ on Fi

Hello everyone!

I know I had questions about the cellular versions of the Galaxy Tab line, so I wanted to share my experience for anyone else who may be wondering!

After plenty of research and digging into tech specs, I took the plunge and got the T-mobile version of the S7+, and I'm happy to say IT WORKS!

I honestly wasn't sure, and was, in fact, prepared to return it if it didn't. But it works on the T-Mobile network, and I'm even getting 5G!

I ordered my unit *directly* from Samsung instead of somewhere like Best Buy (as I'd heard about supposedly unlocked units having issues from Best Buy), and I also didn't want to have to sign up for a contract at a physical store to get my unit. Buying online allowed me to bypass having to activate the device in store to receive it.

Though the tablet came with a T-Mobile activation SIM I never inserted it. I'd ordered a data-only SIM from Fi weeks ago, so before I even turned the tablet on for the first time, I inserted the Fi SIM.

Once it booted, it automatically connected to the Fi network and allowed me to use my data once I'd signed in to my Fi account and installed the Fi app. I initially got a "may not be supported" error for the app, but I said install anyways, and once the I opened the app it works fine.

Yes, it has the pink T-Mobile boot screen, but the network says "Google Fi" when I check, and it's pulling from my data plan (I have unlimited, because even in the pandemic I've been driving all over New England delivering yarn (safely!) and have burned through 10+GB/month for ages).

I wanted to see if this worked now. Because if 2021 goes better than 2020, I'll be working fiber shows across the country (ðŸ¤ž) and will need a good mobile connection to run Square on my tablet as a register. In the past we've used our phones as a Hotspot for a tablet but that means if *we* want to shop we can't take our phones with us! A tablet with its own connection would be great, and I'm happy to say it works!

I don't have access to the other bands through Fi since it's not a "designed for Fi" model, but the T-Mobile network is good enough for what I need it for!

I hope this helps anyone else thinking about a Samsung Tab of some kind. I'd looked at all of the Galaxy Tab models that come with a pen (I'm also going to use that tablet for personal things like art, not just for work), and I decided on the S7+ for a variety of reasons. However, any cellular model for T-Mobile should work base on what I found!

If you've also had good experience, drop a comment so that we can help each other out! 

Please forgive any formatting issues, I typed this up on mobile and may have missed a problem or 2 somewhere ðŸ˜…

**Edit to add:** I activated the SIM card *before* I put it in the tablet. I was going to use it with a different device which is why I had it, and I decided to use it with the S7+ instead. This may have affected my ability to get it working!
