# **Getting started for new Slack users**

A Slack workspace is a single place for your team and your work. If you’ve recently joined one, this guide will help you get set up in Slack so you can get started. Before you dive in, make sure you’ve [downloaded the desktop app](https://slack.com/downloads) and you’re able to [sign in to your workspace](https://slack.com/help/articles/212681477-Sign-in-to-Slack).

## **1. Fill out your profile**

Your [profile](https://slack.com/help/articles/204092246-Edit-your-profile) will help the others you work with in Slack know who you are.

1. From your desktop, click the default profile picture in the top right.
2. Click **Profile** from the menu, then click **Edit profile**.  
3. Let people know what you do and [add a profile photo](https://slack.com/help/articles/115005506003-Upload-a-profile-photo).
4. Click **Save Changes**.

## **2. Configure your notifications**

Your [notifications in Slack](https://slack.com/help/articles/360025446073-Guide-to-Slack-notifications) will alert you of activity in your workspace. You can decide what messages will trigger notifications for you and set other details from your preferences.

1. From your desktop, click your profile picture in the top right. 
2. Select **Preferences** from the menu to open your notification preferences.
3. Choose the activity you’d like to get notified about, then configure any additional notification preferences you’d like.

## **3. Learn how to send messages**

In Slack, you can send messages to other people you work with. If you need to communicate with a group of people, send a message in a [channel](https://slack.com/help/articles/360017938993-What-is-a-channel). To have a one-to-one conversation with someone, send them a [direct message](https://slack.com/help/articles/212281468-Understand-direct-messages).

To start a new message, click the

**compose button**

in the top left.

![https://slack.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/1500009898482/message-compose.png](https://slack.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/1500009898482/message-compose.png)

Visit [Find and start conversations in Slack](https://slack.com/help/articles/1500000019301-Find-and-start-conversations-) to learn more about sending messages.

**Note:** If you’ve been invited to a workspace as a [guest](https://slack.com/help/articles/202518103-Understand-guest-roles-in-Slack), you can only send messages in channels you have access to, and DM people in the same channels as you.

# **Explore Other Slack Features**

Three of the most useful (and fun) built-in Slack features are Quick Switcher, Recent Mentions, and Create Your Own Emojis. Here’s how to use and access these features.

**Quick Switcher**

[Quick Switcher](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/201374536-Slack-keyboard-shortcuts) is the fastest way to jump to a conversation in Slack. To open the box below, **press Command+K on the Mac or Ctrl+K on Windows**.

**Open the Quick Switcher to see a list of Slack channels and conversations for your team.**

You can now quickly **navigate a list of your channels, groups, and direct messages**.

**Tip:** Quick Switcher is just one of many features you can access with a keyboard shortcut. To **see the full list of shortcuts, press Command+? on the Mac or Ctrl+? on Windows**.

**There are keyboard shortcuts for many Slack commands.**

**Recent Mentions**

Another handy feature is Recent Mentions. When you want a specific team member to take notice of a conversation, @mention him or her in your message.

To **check your recent @mentions,** **click the Mentions & Reactions icon (@) in the top-right corner**. You’ll see a list of every time your name has been mentioned in a conversation. **Click on one of the mentions to go directly to that conversation**.

**Create Your Own Emojis**

Custom emojis are easy to create, although you need administrative rights to do so. To get started, **click on your team’s name to open the Team Menu and then select Customize Slack**.

**To get started creating a custom emoji, choose the Customize Slack option from the Team Menu.**

On the next page, **click on the Emoji tab and type in a name for your custom emoji**.
